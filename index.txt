:Abstract: This module implements the spectrograph optical model used for the
    *SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph* [Lantz04]_ data-reduction pipeline,
    and presented in [Copin00]_.  It provides a flexible chromatic mapping
    between the input focal plane and the output detector plane, based on an
    effective simplified ray-tracing model of the key optical
    elements defining the spectrograph (collimator, prism, grating, camera),
    described by a restricted number of physically-motivated distortion
    parameters.

Optical modeling
================

The model only handles the *geometrical* part of the light propagation through
the spectrograph, i.e. provides a mapping between a wavelength and a position
in the entrance focal plane to a position in the detector plane (at the output
focal plane).  It is therefore assumed all the PSF and scattered light effects
(related to focus, axial chromatic aberrations, diffusion, etc.) are modeled
independently.

Optical elements
----------------

The :class:`spectrogrism.Spectrograph` model includes optical elements between
the input focal plane and the output detector plane:

- a :class:`spectrogrism.Collimator`, which converts a position (in the focal
  plane) into a direction
- a :class:`spectrogrism.Grism` (an association of a
  :class:`spectrogrism.Prism` and a :class:`spectrogrism.Grating`), which
  converts a direction into another direction depending on wavelength and
  dispersion order,
- a :class:`spectrogrism.Camera`, which converts a direction into a position
  (in the detector plane).

Both :class:`spectrogrism.Collimator` and :class:`spectrogrism.Camera` include
geometric radial distortion and lateral colors (transverse chromatic
aberrations).  :class:`spectrogrism.Prism` includes 3D-tilts.

   **Figure:** Modeling of 5×5 sources in the detector plane at 10 individual
   wavelengths, using the SNIFS-R optical configuration.  Orders -1 (very top),
   0 (undispersed), 1 (middle) and 2 (bottom) are represented.  The size of the
   symbol somehow encodes the blaze function of the spectrograph.

A :class:`spectrogrism.Telescope` helper class, which converts a
direction in the sky into a position in the focal plane, is also
provided.

Positions and directions
------------------------

* A 2D-position :math:`(x, y)` is encoded in complex number :math:`x + jy`.
* A 2D-direction :math:`(\theta, \phi)` (where :math:`\theta` is the angle
  between the optical axis :math:`Oz` and the propagation direction, and
  :math:`\phi` the phase in the transverse plane :math:`(Oxy)`) is encoded in
  complex number :math:`\tan(\theta) \exp(j\phi)`.
* A 3D-direction is encoded by the coordinates of the unit-vector :math:`(x, y,
  z)`.

Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP)
================================================

The `spectrogrism` optical model is used to simulate the Near Infrared
Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) of EUCLID.  Julien Zoubian provided full
sky-to-detector Zemax 1st-order simulations for a nominal NISP configuration.
