:Abstract: This module initially implemented the spectrograph optical model
           used for the TIGER-like integral field spectrograph (e.g. SAURON
           [Bacon01]_ and SNIFS [Lantz04]_) data-reduction pipeline, and first
           presented in [Copin00]_.  It provides a flexible chromatic mapping
           between the input focal plane and the output detector plane, based
           on an effective simplified ray-tracing model of the key optical
           elements defining the spectrograph (collimator, prism, grating,
           camera), described by a restricted number of physically-motivated
           distortion parameters.

Optical modeling
================

The model only handles the *geometrical* part of the light propagation through
the spectrograph, i.e. provides a mapping between a wavelength and a position
in the entrance focal plane to a position in the detector plane (at the output
focal plane).  It is therefore assumed all the PSF and scattered light effects
(related to focus, axial chromatic aberrations, diffusion, etc.) are modeled
independently.

Optical elements
----------------

The :class:`spectrogrism.Spectrograph` model includes optical elements between
the input focal plane and the output detector plane:

- an optional :class:`spectrogrism.Telescope`, which converts a direction in
  the sky into a position in the focal plane;
- a :class:`spectrogrism.Collimator`, which converts a position (in the focal
  plane) into a direction;
- a :class:`spectrogrism.Grism` (an association of a
  :class:`spectrogrism.Prism` and a :class:`spectrogrism.Grating`), which
  converts a direction into another direction depending on wavelength and
  dispersion order;
- a :class:`spectrogrism.Camera`, which converts a direction into a position
  (in the detector plane);
- a :class:`spectrogrism.Detector`, which actually project positions onto the
  translated and rotated detector.

Both :class:`spectrogrism.Collimator` and :class:`spectrogrism.Camera` include
geometric quadratic radial distortion and lateral colors (transverse chromatic
aberrations).  :class:`spectrogrism.Prism` includes 3D-tilts.

Positions and directions
------------------------

* A 2D-position :math:`(x, y)` is encoded in complex number :math:`x + jy =
  r\,\exp(j\varphi)`.
* A 2D-direction :math:`(\theta, \phi)` -- where :math:`\theta` is the angle
  between the optical axis :math:`Oz` and the propagation direction, and
  :math:`\phi` the phase in the transverse plane :math:`(Oxy)` -- is encoded in
  complex number :math:`\tan(\theta)\,\exp(j\phi)`.
* A 3D-direction is encoded by the coordinates of the unit-vector :math:`(x, y,
  z)`.

Distortions
-----------

* A :class:`distortion.StructuredGrid` is a structured grid of
  (complex) 2D-positions, with plotting and distortion-adjustment
  facilities.
* :class:`distortion.GeometricDistortion` implements the full Brown-Conrady
  (achromatic) distortion model, including radial and tangential components of
  arbitrary orders.
* :class:`distortion.ChromaticDistortion` is a minimal lateral-color
  distortion implementation.

Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP)
================================================

Zemax simulations
-----------------

The :mod:`spectrogrism` optical model is used to simulate the *Near Infrared
Spectrometer and Photometer* (NISP) of EUCLID, mimicking full sky-to-detector
Zemax spectroscopic and photometric simulations for a nominal NISP
configuration (courtesy J. Zoubian).

.. topic:: Questions regarding the current Zemax simulation:

   * input y-coordinates are offset by +0.85 deg
   * output y-coordinates are not centered: (dx, dy) = (+0.7, 179.8) mm,
     corresponding to (+0.7, -4.2) mm for centered y-coordinates
   * input position (+0.4, +1.25) is missing the 1.85 µm wavelength

NISP optical design
-------------------

The NISP optical design is presented in [Grupp12]_ and updated in [Grupp14]_
(see :numref:`fig#nisp_optdesign`).

.. _fig#nisp_optdesign:

   The EUCLID f#20 to f#10 relay system including filter and grating position
   (from [Grupp12]_).

It consists of:

0. an f/20 1.2 m diameter Korsch type three mirror telescope in off-axis
   configuration
1. the Corrector Lens assembly CoLA (fused silica)
2. depending on the observing mode:

   **photometric mode (NISP-P)**: 
     a filter with mildly powered spherical entrance surface and flat exit
     surface (fused silica)

   **spectroscopic mode (NISP-S)**:
     a grism with mildly powered spherical entrance surface and binary optic
     (curved line) grating exit surface (fused silica)
   
   These intrinsically static elements are placed in filter/grism wheels with
   limited position repeatibility.
   
3. the Camera Lens assembly CaLA (CaF2/S-FTM16/S-FTM16), providing an f/10 beam.
4. 16 2k×2k IR detectors

The objective of this work is to assess the possibility to model in an
effective way the NISP-S optical scheme in order to be able to predict
multi-order spectrum locations from photometric catalogs.
